JASMINe (JACK Audio StreaM InterfacE) is a stream based front-end API for JACK. Since it is not possible to use any I/O function from the JACK audio thread, an additional layer is needed for dealing with playback/record to/from disks, network etc. This library contains a streaming client for use with JACK.
